## Overview of the analysis
This project uses the power of Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to efficently produce a report of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Summary statistics of temperature data were pulled for the months of June and December to see if a prospective surf and ice cream shop is able to operate throughout the year as opposed to a seasonal business.

## Results
- The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December (71). 
- The smaller standard deviation in June means that the frequency of temperatures recorded in June has a more normal distribution than December temperatures. 
- The December temperatures are more variable than those in June because of the larger range in recorded temperatures. We see this by comparing the max vs min temperature of each month.

## Summary
Despite temperatures recorded in December varying more than those in June, December still provides adequate weather conditions for both surfing and eating ice cream. The average temperatures in June and December only differ by 4 degrees, which isn't significant enough to turn customers away in December. Additional queries to gather more weather data for June and December would be reviewing other important factors that determine optimal beach and surfing weather such as precipitation, wave swells and wind condition.
